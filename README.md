# Simple Fruits

Simple Fruits is a mod and datapack that adds a variety of new fruits to the game in the same manner as vanilla Minecraft's apple.

Each tree now drops a unique fruit which can be crafted into its respective golden fruit, with different effects for each one!

This mod is intended to be used alongside Farmer's Delight however will work as a standalone.

This mod is free to use in any modpack as long as you credit me as the author.

No forge version is planned, however you are free to port it yourself.
